### Building Recommender Systems with PyTorch - Tutorial at KDD 2020
=================================================================================
*Dheevatsa Mudigere, Maxim Naumov, Geeta Chauhan, Joe Spisak*

In this tutorial we show how to build deep learning recommendation systems and resolve the associated interpretability, integrity and privacy challenges. We start with an overview of the PyTorch framework, features that it offers and a brief review of the evolution of recommendation models. We delineate their typical components and build a proxy deep learning recommendation model [DLRM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dlrm) in PyTorch. Then, we discuss how to interpret recommendation system results as well as how to address the corresponding integrity and quality challenges.

The material will be presented in the following talks:
Why PyTorch?
Recommender Systems using DLRM
Using [Captum](https://captum.ai/) for Interpretability for recommender systems
Solving integrity / QC challenges for recommender systems

The tutorial will start with basic concepts and will proceed into more advanced topics following a chronological order of the presentations. The audience is expected to have some basic understanding of deep learning frameworks and models that will be supplemented with the material in the early talks. The audience will have an opportunity to learn more advanced topics and models as the tutorial proceeds.
